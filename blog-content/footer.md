It feels like testing and documentation are the two major aspects of software engineering that are being neglected by many engineers.
Every day I get the benefits of automated testing and maintainable documentation. I would be thrilled if you get to exprience the benefits as well.

In addition, testing and documentation are intertwined, and gets stronget together. In some of the articles I try to show you how much exactly. 

I am new at writing, and especially English writing. Please be kind and suggest grammar improvements with [Pull Requests](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/blog)

I work on two open source projects to help with testing and documentation. Check them out.

[WebTau](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/webtau) - is a testing API, command line tool and a framework to write unit, integration and end-to-end tests. 
Test across REST-API, Graph QL, Browser, Database, CLI and Business Logic with consistent set of matchers and concepts. REPL mode speeds-up tests development. 
Rich reporting cuts down investigation time.

[Znai](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai) - build functional, maintainable, beautiful User Guides with markdown and Znai plugins. 
Instant pages navigation. Local search. Multiple integrations to work with Python, Java, C++, OpenAPI, etc. 
Transform "getting started" sections into slideshow for your workshops. Manage multiple documentations with self-deployed znai hub
