The power of exercising any piece of your software in O(1) keystrokes.Let me try to explain."],["entry@@testing-makes-you-faster-day-one@@building-a-medieval-castle","Entry","Testing Makes You Faster Day One","Building A Medieval Castle","We are going to build a Castle, add features to it, and do a manual inspection of our creation as we go.Let's start small. All we need is a single room and a throne to sit on.Perfect! So let's test it. Quickly get in, walk through the room, sit on the throne. All is good.Let's add a few more rooms and a chest.Our goal is to test if we can open that chest. This time we have to do a little bit more legs work. This time a simple check took as a few minutes longer.Let's add a bit of security to our castle by adding keys and levers.We have to test each door and to do that we need to go through our entire castle. This makes a good test and a very important one.During our next development iteration we decided to add a new smart lock to our chest, so we can open it with our retina.We gotta test this feature. So we open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door and another one, to pull the lever, to run the stairs through the opened door. After catching our breath we try to open a chest.A day later, we decide to add an auto lock after three failed attempt. And so we bring a friend who is not registered with our castle to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, ... to ..., ..., to try to fail to open a chest.A few iterations later the Security Department expressed the concern that our security could use an upgrade. A trap, puzzle and a dragon later we are ready to deploy.As before we gotta test every new added Security feature. This is a good test and a very important one. We get caught in a trap, we jump over the trap, we play rock/paper/scissors to lose and to win, open the door, get eaten by the dragon, defeat the dragon and finally reach the chest. All tests passed.Another development iteration passes and we decided to make scissors game to be lefty friendly.And so we bring a friend who is lefty, can jump over traps, to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, to jump over trap, to open a door, to play rock/paper/scissorsA day later we decided to add a fingerprint reader to our chestAnd so we bring a friend who is lefty, not registered with our castle, who can jump over traps, who won't be scared of a dragon, to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, to jump over trap, to open a door, to play rock/paper/scissors, to open a lever, to challenge a dragon, to put a finger to a chest.It should be clear by now that the more features we add to the castle, the more time it takes to do a check routine of a single feature. What is interesting is that the big portion of the time is spend getting to the feature we want to test and not the test itself.Having said all that let's add another floor to the castle.There is a new room where you can grab any gear you want and also play a loot box game. Don't worry we won't be running through the castle to test loot box game algorithm (one entire castle run for a single try)Instead, we will create teleports"],["entry@@testing-makes-you-faster-day-one@@teleports-system","Entry","Testing Makes You Faster Day One","Teleports System","Instead of running around the castle, fighting dragons and jumping over traps, wouldn't it be easier to just appear in certain castle places to perform our routines?Let's add a teleport right next to our new loot box game. Next time we tweak loot algorithm we won't run around the castle, we just show up right where we need to be.Regardless of how big our castle will become, regardless of how many more traps and doors we will add between the castle entrance and the loot floor, when we need to tweak and test our loot box algorithm, we just show up right there.Let's add teleports next to more points of interests, so next time when we tweak our features we can test them in an instance.On our first day we only had one room and a throne at the end. But if on the same day we would add a teleport next to the throne - we would already be saving time running through the room.Teleporting would make us faster day one."],["entry@@testing-makes-you-faster-day-one@@implementing-teleports","Entry","Testing Makes You Faster Day One","Implementing Teleports","The castle we have built is your app. And the main entrance is your language main function.One way to implement teleports is to implement more than one main file with its own main function. java class ChestTeleport { public static void main() { FingerAuth wrongAuth = new FingerAuth('wrongPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); assert !chest.open(wrongAuth); FingerAuth validAuth = new FingerAuth('validPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); assert chest.open(validAuth)); } } If you do just that it is already going to be a time saver. Any time you want to test a different portion of your castle, you just use a different file to execute.As the number of teleports grow it may become harder to sort through them to pick one to use. Also teleports that are rarely used may become obsolete and point you to non existing parts of your castle.Fortunately most languages have a testing framework to define and structure teleports. Moreover they will make sure that teleports are still functioning. java class ChestTest { @Test public void invalidFingerAuth() { FingerAuth wrongAuth = new FingerAuth('wrongPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); Assert.assertFalse(chest.open(auth)); } @Test public void validFingerAuth() { FingerAuth validAuth = new FingerAuth('validPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); Assert.assertTrue(chest.open(auth)); } } This is the untapped power of tests I was talking about at the begging. The power of exercising any piece of your software in O(1) keystrokes. Regardless of how large or small you software is. You are going to be consistently productive day one, day two, day hundred and day thousand. Tweaking your castle and validating it in the matters of seconds, using the ever growing system of teleports."]]
