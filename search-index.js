All we need is a single room and a throne to sit on.Perfect! So let's test it. Quickly get in, walk through the room, sit on the throne. All is good.Let's add a few more rooms and a chest.Our goal is to test if we can open that chest. This time we have to do a little bit more legwork. This time, a simple check took us a few minutes longer.Let's add a bit of security to our castle by adding keys and levers.We have to test each door and to do that we need to go through our entire castle. This makes a good test and a very important one.For our next iteration we decided to add a new smart lock to our chest, so we can open it with our retina.We gotta test this feature. So we open a jar, to pick a key, to open first one door and then to open the other door, to pull the lever, to run the stairs through the opened door. After catching our breath we try to open a chest.A day later, we decide to add an auto lock after three failed attempt. And so we bring a friend who is not registered with our castle to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, ... to ..., ..., to try to fail to open a chest.A few iterations later the Security Department expressed the concern that our security could use an upgrade. A trap, puzzle and a dragon later we are ready to deploy.As before, we gotta test every new added Security feature. This is a good test and a very important one. We get caught in a trap, we jump over the trap, we play rock/paper/scissors to lose and to win, open the door, get eaten by the dragon, defeat the dragon and finally reach the chest. All tests passed.Another development iteration passes and we decided to make scissors game to be lefty friendly.And so we bring a friend who is a lefty, can jump over traps, to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, to jump over trap, to open a door, to play rock/paper/scissorsA day later we decided to add a fingerprint reader to our chestAnd so we bring another friend who is a lefty, who is not registered with our castle, who can jump over traps, who won't be scared of a dragon, to open a jar, to pick a key, to open a door, to jump over trap, to open a door, to play rock/paper/scissors, to open a lever, to challenge a dragon, to put a finger to a chest.It should be clear by now that the more features we add to the castle, the more time it takes to do a check routine of a single feature. What is interesting is that the big portion of the time is spend getting to the feature we want to test and not the test itself.Having said all that let's add another floor to the castle.There is a new room where you can grab any gear you want and also play a loot box game. Don't worry we won't be running through the castle to test loot box game algorithm (one entire castle run for a single try)Instead, we will create teleports"],["entry@@testing-makes-you-faster-day-one@@teleports-system","Entry","Testing Makes You Faster Day One","Teleports System","Instead of running around the castle, fighting dragons and jumping over traps, wouldn't it be easier to just appear in certain castle places to perform our routines?Let's add a teleport right next to our new loot box game.

But if on the same day we would add a teleport next to the throne - we would already be saving time running through the room.Teleporting would make us faster day one."],["entry@@testing-makes-you-faster-day-one@@implementing-teleports","Entry","Testing Makes You Faster Day One","Implementing Teleports","The castle we have built is your app. And the main entrance is your language main function.One way to build teleports is to implement more than one main file with its own main function. java class ChestTeleport { public static void main() { FingerAuth wrongAuth = new FingerAuth('wrongPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); assert !chest.open(wrongAuth); FingerAuth validAuth = new FingerAuth('validPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); assert chest.open(validAuth)); } } If you do just that it is already going to be a time saver. Any time you want to test a different portion of your castle, you just use a different teleport - a different file to execute.As the number of teleports grow it may become harder to sort through them to pick one to use. Also teleports that are rarely used may become obsolete and point you to non existing parts of your castle.Fortunately most languages have a testing framework to define and structure your teleports. Moreover they will make sure that teleports are still functioning. java class ChestTest { @Test public void invalidFingerAuth() { FingerAuth wrongAuth = new FingerAuth('wrongPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); Assert.assertFalse(chest.open(auth)); } @Test public void validFingerAuth() { FingerAuth validAuth = new FingerAuth('validPerson'); SmartLockChest chest = new Chest(); Assert.assertTrue(chest.open(auth)); } } This is the untapped power of tests I was talking about at the beginning - the power to exercise any piece of your software in one button press.

A minute later you realize that your company doesn't have employees with the same last name that have birthdays on the same day.

However, there are test patterns that most likely will slow you down and you need to be ready to handle them.Writing tests for a simple logic with a simple input is a breeze. Take for example a test for a simple calculator class. Two numeric inputs and we are done: package com.example.portfolio; import org.junit.Assert; import org.junit.Test; public class SimpleCalculatorTest { @Test public void zeroMultiply() { SimpleCalculator simpleCalculator = new SimpleCalculator(); Assert.assertEquals(0, simpleCalculator.multiply(100.0, 0.0), 0.0); Assert.assertEquals(0, simpleCalculator.multiply(-100.0, 0.0), 0.0); } } However real apps require real domain, and real domain is rarely represented by a couple of numbers. Let's take Finance as an example. It is full of types with multiple fields such as Transaction , and it has a lot of business logic.One example of such business logic is ProfitCalculator . Its job is to calculate profit based on the executed Transactions .After consulting with the business people, we are ready to give our implementation a shot. Transaction is a data class with a few fields (number of fields is reduced for simplicity). package com.example.portfolio; import javax.persistence.Entity; import javax.persistence.Id; @Entity public class Transaction { private String id; private double lot; private double price; private String symbol; @Id public String getId() { return id; } public void setId(String id) { this.id = id; } public double getLot() { return lot; } public void setLot(double lot) { this.lot = lot; } public double getPrice() { return price; } public void setPrice(double price) { this.price = price; } public String getSymbol() { return symbol; } public void setSymbol(String symbol) { this.symbol = symbol; } } Here is our first ProfitCalculator implementation, ready to be tested. package com.example.portfolio; import java.util.List; public class ProfitCalculator { public ProfitCalculator() { } public double calculate(List<Transaction> transactions) { return 0; } } And here is the first version of our test. package com.example.portfolio; import org.junit.Test; import java.util.Arrays; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; public class ProfitCalculatorWithoutEncapsulationTest { private final ProfitCalculator profitCalculator = new ProfitCalculator(); @Test public void profitShouldBeZeroIfNoLotsSet() { Transaction t1 = new Transaction(); t1.setId(\"T1\"); t1.setSymbol(\"SYM.B\"); t1.setLot(0); t1.setPrice(8); Transaction t2 = new Transaction(); t1.setId(\"T2\"); t1.setSymbol(\"SYM.C\"); t1.setLot(0); t1.setPrice(19); assertEquals(0, profitCalculator.calculate(Arrays.asList(t1, t2)), 0); } } This test is already on the verbose side. As requirements for the ProfitCalculator evolve, the number of setters we need to validate new business logic will grow, as will grow the number of instances that we may need to create.Question: But why verbose test can be bad? A verbose test can be bad, because the boilerplate code used to setup the test makes it harder to read intent behind the test. Additionally it may discourage you to write separate test scenario and instead you may want to clump test scenarios together and re-use the test data setup. Test data re-use can lead to a random test being broken as you setup data for an unrelated scenario. Verbosity is not the only potential problem here. The way Transaction instance is being constructed for testing purposes can lead to a maintenance burden.The First iteration of Transaction class uses setters to set the data. A future iteration may switch to using fluent API instead of setters . transaction(\"T1\") .symbol(\"SYM.B\") .lot(0) .price(0); From the ProfitCalculator 's perspective the way Transaction instances are created is irrelevant as it doesn't affect the calculation logic. But refactoring Transaction will break ProfitCalculatorTest . Transaction is going to be used in other tests. As the number of tests that use Transaction instances increases you will be more and more reluctant to do refactoring. All your tests that create Transaction instances are brittle tests now. They are brittle because they won't survive Transaction refactoring.If you ever want to refactor Transaction class you will have two choices:Refactor and waste time fixing tests. Convince yourself that Transaction is good as it is. Neither is a good choice.I want you to have a way to protect your future self by encapsulating test input preparation"],["entry@@protect-your-future-self-by-encapsulating-test-input-preparation@@test-input-initial-encapsulation","Entry","Protect Your Future Self By Encapsulating Test Input Preparation","Test Input Initial Encapsulation","Let's extract Transaction creation code into TestTransactions package com.example.portfolio; import org.junit.Test; import java.util.Arrays; import static com.example.portfolio.TestTransactions.createTransaction; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; public class ProfitCalculatorWithBasicEncapsulationTest { private final ProfitCalculator profitCalculator = new ProfitCalculator(); @Test public void profitShouldBeZeroIfNoLotsSet() { Transaction t1 = createTransaction(\"t1\", \"SYM.B\", 0, 8); Transaction t2 = createTransaction(\"t2\", \"SYM.C\", 0, 19); assertEquals(0, profitCalculator.calculate(Arrays.asList(t1, t2)), 0); } } public static Transaction createTransaction(String id, String symbol, double lot, double price) { Transaction transaction = new Transaction(); transaction.setId(id); transaction.setSymbol(symbol); transaction.setLot(lot); transaction.setPrice(price); return transaction; } Less verbosity.

As a result of this, tests that don't need, say, id or lot are free to ignore them. @Test public void profitShouldBeZeroIfNoLotsSet() { TableData transactionsData = table(\"symbol\", \"lot\", ________________, \"SYM.B\" , 0.0, \"SYM.C\" , 0.0); double margin = profitCalculator.calculate(createTransactions(transactionsData)); actual(margin).should(equal(0)); } If later a new required property will be added to Transaction , you won't have to change all your existing tests. Instead you will update createTransaction with a new default value. The only time you will have to change the tests to use the new property is if the new property is affecting the logic under test.Essentially your test will use as little data to prove logic works as possible.Question: Why it is important to minimize the data in your test?

You can see the list of operations we yet to test on the left ( 2 ). Number of items on the left matches the number in the summary card ( 3 ). We can use panel at the bottom ( 4 ) to switch between skipped, total, passed operations or tests.Let's navigate from Summary tab to Overal HTTP Performance tab. The screen shows high level picture of how performant our server is under test load. While it is not a true performance test, it may give you an initial glance into things that may need a closer look.HTTP Operations Performance tab provides a performance information based on Open API defined operations.Let's get back to tests view ( 1 ) and select a test ( 2 ). First screen we are going to see is a test Summary ( 3 ) with high level information on time taken.If a test performed any HTTP calls, you going to see the HTTP Calls tab ( 1 ). It contains every HTTP call performed with captured request, response and assertions ( 2 and 3 ) information.If a test performed any CLI calls, you going to see the CLI Calls tab ( 1 ). It contains every CLI call performed with captured command, output and assertions ( 2 ) information.Every test also has Steps tab ( 1 ) that contains every step test performed, time it took, and what Persona if any performed the step ( 2 and 3 )"],["entry@@ultimate-end-to-end-test@@repl","Entry","Ultimate End To End Test","REPL","REPL stands for read-eval-print-loop.
