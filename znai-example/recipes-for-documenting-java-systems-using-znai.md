# NoDocs Land Of Enterprise 

Maybe it is my luck, but almost all big companies I worked for had a very poor documentation for their essential systems.
The reason is simple - documentation is hard and it takes time. 

Why documentation is hard and why it takes time? I think it is the combination of several factors:
* It is a skill that we don't train
* Lack of patterns
* Unfamiliarity of tooling  

Remember how hard it was to grasp arrays, nested for-loops, interfaces, visitor pattern, list comprehension? Well it was hard for me. 
Then it became a trained skill. Then I settled on patterns when to use what. Now there is a minimum mental load to decide when to pick what and how to use it. 
Add on top of that a good tool like [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and it takes little time to implement your idea.  

I am convinced the same is true about documentation writing. It is the skill that needs to be trained. 
The patterns that needs to be discovered and learnt. And add on top of that a decent documentation tool and it will take you little time to write a useful documentation.
